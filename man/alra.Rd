\usage{
alra(A_norm, k = 0, q = 10, do.par = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_norm}{The log-transformed expression matrix of cells (rows) vs. genes (columns)}

\item{k}{the rank of the rank-k approximation. Set to 0 for automated choice of k.}

\item{q}{the number of additional power iterations in randomized SVD}
}
\value{
A list with three items
}
\description{
Computes the k-rank approximation to A_norm and adjusts 
it according to the error distribution learned from the negative values.
